# Remember All
### Rochelle Crain and Megan Jensen

## Description
RememberAll is a memorial app that makes creating a memory of a loved one a simpler process. This app's main purpose is to normalize and modernize the grieving process. Through RememberAll the user can create a profile page for their loved one and fill the page with pictures, vidoes, and notes. This profile can be shared and collaborated on through social media. The main feed of this page will include all of a user's loved ones so they have somewhere safe to remember all the people who they hold dear. 

## Origin
RememberAll was created after the app designer, Megan Jensen, lost her mother, grandfather, and friend in 2016. She wanted a way to remember her people and compile all the pictures, but there wasn't a good option. All the available memorial websites were clunky and outdated. She didn't feel like there was a good online space to create a community to grieve and share their memories. After seeing how people used social media to fill this need she came up with the idea of RememberAll, a social memorial app. She saw the need to create a space to remember all the people lost and to create a forever memorial of loved ones online. The app became a reality after discussing the idea with friend and app developer Rochelle Crain. Together they hope to normalize grief and create a community on the RememberAll app.
